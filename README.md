TtHT is a frivolous browser extension that, well, does just about what you'd think it'd do. You can find it on the [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/theorem-to-hot-take/hbbdnfgkdhchhblbaoklpbfhlohacbdh).

Inspired by a [@tesseralis tweet](https://twitter.com/tesseralis/status/1170116817550856193).
